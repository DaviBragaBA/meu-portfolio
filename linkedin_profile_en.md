**Option 1 (more technical):**
Business Analyst | Core Limit Policies (Excellence) | Credit card limits, NPV and limit experiments (BR/MX)

**Option 2 (simpler):**
Business Analyst in Core Limit Policies | Credit card limit policies, NPV and credit risk

**Option 3 (impact‑focused):**
Business Analyst | Optimizing credit card limits through NPV, experiments and credit monitoring

## 2.2 "About" section

I am a Business Analyst in Core Limit Policies (Excellence), focused on credit card limit policies for Brazil and Mexico. Day to day, I connect data, risk/revenue models and product to design, test and monitor limit increase policies based on Net Present Value (NPV).

I work with limit experiments (test vs control), analyzing impact on purchase volume, interest‑bearing average daily balance, outstanding balance and risk. From that, I help adjust caps, blocks and eligibility rules, always looking at the trade‑off between revenues, losses, capital and exposure.

I build monitoring pipelines in Databricks, create internal dashboards for budget and policy performance, and take part in implementing changes in the production policy (for example, compliance‑related blocking rules in Mexico). My goal is to make limit decisions more precise, safe and profitable, using data in a structured and transparent way.

## 2.3 Current experience – role description

**Title:**
Business Analyst – Core Limit Policies (Excellence)

**Company:** Nubank  
**Dates:** (e.g., Mar 2025 – Present)  
**Location:** São Paulo, Brazil (or Remote, Brazil)

**Description:**

- Analyze credit card limit increase experiments by comparing test and control groups, measuring impact on purchase volume, interest‑bearing average daily balance, outstanding balance and credit limit.
- Compute metrics such as delta purchase volume, delta interest‑bearing average daily balance, delta outstanding balance and marginal utilization (for example, extra purchase volume per extra unit of limit) to understand whether the limit increase is healthy in terms of usage, revenues and risk.
- Develop monitoring pipelines in Databricks for Brazil and Mexico, aggregating budget metrics by business month, risk band, policy and version, aligned with FP&A views.
- Build and evolve internal dashboards for budget and policy metrics to track, almost in real time, the performance of policies and limit experiments in BR and MX.
- Contribute to the implementation of production policy rules (for example, compliance‑related blocking rules in Mexico), adjusting input datasets and decision blocks in central data and policy repositories.
- Partner with data engineers and data scientists to align risk models, average balance models and NPV curves with policy practice, ensuring that monitoring and decisions accurately reflect real portfolio behavior.
- Document analyses, decisions and learnings in Confluence, Google Docs and presentation decks, helping translate NPV, risk and revenue concepts into clear narratives for both technical and business stakeholders.
